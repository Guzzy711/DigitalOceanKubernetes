# DigitalOceanKubernetes

I had to install homebrew inorder to install and configure doctl. Dotctl is Digital Oceans own cmd line interface. 


```bash
# installing homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
# installing dotctl
brew install doctl
```
